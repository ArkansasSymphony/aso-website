Traveling to schools throughout Arkansas, the Quapaw Quartet and Rockefeller Quartet are eight of the Arkansas Symphony's full-time musicians and educators.  Four brand new 30 minute demos are offered every school year to introduce 2nd through 8th grade students to different concepts in music.  Each demo can be linked to your class curriculum in many subjects.  In addition, instrumental petting zoos give each student an up close experience with string instruments!
