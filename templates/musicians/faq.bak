				be found on the <a href="/musicians/venues/">Maps & Directions</a> page.<br/><br/>

				Whenever possible, all music scheduled for performance shall be made available to the musicians no later 
				than two (2) weeks prior to rehearsal of that music. Music shall be delivered either in person or by mail, 
				or made available either at the Society's offices or at scheduled orchestra services. Musicians living 
				within Pulaski County are expected, when possible, to get their music themselves. If a musician is unable 
				to pick up his/her music during office hours, arrangements may be made with the Society to either have the 
				music mailed, copies of the music mailed or another mutually agreed upon method for facilitating this exchange.<br/><br/>

				<a href="/musicians/forms/service-claim/">Service Claim Form</a> in order for the reimbursement to appear 
				on the musician's paycheck.  In addition to mileage, musicians should use the <a href="/musicians/forms/service-claim/">Service Claim Form</a> 
				to claim reimbursement for doubling, cartage, and per-diem when applicable.<br/><br/>
				
				<hr/><a name="q7"></a>
				<strong>Will the ASO put me up in a hotel?</strong><br/><br/>
				Yes.  Musicians traveling from outside of Pulaski County will be put up in a hotel at no expense to the musician, 
				so long as the musician is willing to have another musician as a roommate.  Musicians requiring a single room may 
				request this, but will be expected to pay 50% of the room cost (deducted from the musician's paycheck).  All 
				incidental charges will be the responsibility of the musician.  To request a hotel room, please use the 
				<a href="/musicians/forms/hotel-request/">Hotel Request Form</a>.<br/><br/>
